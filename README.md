# Frequency Queries

You are given **q** queries. Each query is of the form two integers described below:

-1 **x**: Insert x in your data structure.

-2 **y**: Delete one occurence of y from your data structure, if present

-3 **z**: Check if any integer is present whose frequency is exactly **z**. If yes, print 1 else 0.

The queries are given in the form of a 2-D array **queries** of size **q** where **queries[i][0]** contains the operation, and 
**queries[i][1]** contains the data element. For example, you are given array

```
queries = [(1,1), (2,2), (3,2),  (1,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,2)]
```
The results of each operation are:
```
Operation   Array   Output
(1,1)       [1]
(2,2)       [1]
(3,2)                   0
(1,1)       [1,1]
(1,1)       [1,1,1]
(2,1)       [1,1]
(3,2)                   1
```
return an array with the output: **[0,1]**

## Function Description
Complete the freqQuery function. It must return an array of integers where each element is a 1
if there is at least one element value with the queried number of occurrences in the current array, or 0 if there is not.

freqQuery has the following parameter(s):

queries: a 2-d array of integers

## Input format
The first line contains of an integer **q**, the number of queries.
Each of the next **q** lines contains two integers denoting the 2-d array **queries**.

## Constraints

* **1 <= q <= 10^6**
* **1 <= x,y,z <= 10^9**
* **1 <= queries[i][1] <= 10^9**

## Output Format
Return an integer array consisting of all the outputs of queries of type **3**.

## Sample Input 0
```
8
1 5
1 6
3 2
1 10
1 10
1 6
2 5
3 2
```
# Sample Output 0
```
0
1
```

# Explanation O
For the first query of type **3**, there is no integer whose frequency is **2(array=[5,6])**. So answer is **0**.
For the second query of type **3**, there are two integers in **array = [6, 10, 10, 6]** 
whose frequency is **2(integers = 6 and 10 )**. So, the answer is **1**.
